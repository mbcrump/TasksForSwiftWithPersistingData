The original blog post for this article can be found [here,](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/creating-task-application-ios-using-swift/) but it does not include some of the cosmetic tweaks that this version has, nor does it persist data. If you are looking for a simple example of creating a Task app then check my my other [repo.](https://github.com/mbcrump/TasksForSwift)

Below is a demo from the app that is in the AppStore:
